# Prodigy Info Tech - ðŸ§  Customer Segmentation using K-Means
This project applies the K-Means clustering algorithm to segment customers of a retail store based on their spending patterns.

As part of my Virtual Machine Learning Internship, I successfully completed a project on Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering. The objective of this task was to build an intuitive and interactive web application using Streamlit that classifies customers into different segments based on their purchasing behavior.

The backend model was trained on the widely used Mall Customers Dataset, focusing on key features such as Age, Annual Income, and Spending Score. The data was standardized using StandardScaler, and the clustering model was developed using the K-Means algorithm. The trained model and scaler were serialized using Pickle, and the application was built using Python, Streamlit, and basic UI elements for ease of interaction.
